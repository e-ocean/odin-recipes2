    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Think you can only get poke bowls at a restaurant? Think again! This Poke Bowl Recipe is SO easy to make at home, and once you DO make it at home, you may never order it at a restaurant again.</p>
        <p>Our version of a poke bowl recipe is made with saucy ahi tuna, sticky brown rice, crunchy carrots and cucumber, edamame, lots of avocado, and of course, plenty of spicy mayo. It’s the perfect combination of sweet, salty, spicy, crunchy, sticky, and ALL the things. The beauty of this Poke Bowl Recipe is that it’s totally customizable. Love salmon? Use that instead. Not into edamame? Leave it out. No problem. Of course, I think the combination of OUR recipe is the ultimate poke bowl, so there’s that.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="pokelist">
        <li>Ahi Tuna</li>
        <li>The seasonings</li>
        <li>The veggies</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Mayo</li>
        <li>Sriracha</li>
        <li>Green onion and black sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Brown rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the rice.</strong> Brown rice takes a little longer to cook than white rice, so be aware of that. My rice cooker usually cooks it in about 40 minutes. You can also do this step ahead of time.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate the tuna.</strong> Use a VERY sharp knife to cut the ahi tuna into a bite-size dice. Add to a medium bowl. Stir with soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, and sesame oil. Let the ahi tuna marinate while you prep the rest of the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the spicy mayo.</strong> Add the mayo and sriracha to a small bowl. Stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Add the mayo to a small ziplock baggie. Cut a small piece of the corner off.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the bowls.</strong> Told you this was easy! Spoon the cooked rice into a bowl. Spoon the marinated tuna over the rice. Arrange the cucumber, carrot, and edamame around it. Fan out the avocado on top. Sprinkle with sesame deeds and chopped green onion. Drizzle with spicy mayo.
